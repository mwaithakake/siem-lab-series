# SIEM Lab Series: Building a Security Monitoring Environment with Splunk

This repository documents a hands-on journey through the core components of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Splunk. The project is structured as a lab series, with each lab building on the previous to simulate real-world SIEM functionality ‚Äî from log ingestion to dashboards, alerts, and reporting.
